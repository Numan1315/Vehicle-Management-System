Front-end: We used HTML and CSS for our front end. HTML—“HyperText Markup Language”—is the language used to tell your web browser what each part of a website is. So, using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you're looking at. CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.


Back-end: Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file. Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. Psycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper, resulting in being both efficient and secure. It ensures client-side and server-side cursors, asynchronous communication. 


DataBase: POSTGRESQL Free and open source, available in multiple languages, highly extensible, protects data integrity, builds fault-tolerant environments, robust access-control system.
